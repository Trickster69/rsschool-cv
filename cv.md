## I'm 26 years old. I've been studying frontend for the last six months. For a year I was engaged in manual testing on crowdtesting platforms (mostly Utest). I have experience in traffic arbitration, and writing automation for sending emails. In RS School, I want to get enough experience to develop real projects. My strengths are discipline and self-learning skills.
